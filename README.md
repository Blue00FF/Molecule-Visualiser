# Molecule-Visualiser
A program that takes as input a csv file containing relative positions of Water particles, groups them by molecule and gives a graph of the particles joined by lines representing bonds with a slider to rotate it.
This is the final project that I made for the Introduction to Scientific Computing course that I took as part of my Theoretical Physics degree.
